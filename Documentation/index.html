Post Format
===========

[Post Formats](http://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Formats) is theme feature which is a piece of meta information that can be used by a theme to customize its presentation of a post.

In short, with a theme that supports Post Formats, a blogger can change how each post looks by choosing a Post Format from a radio-button list.

gocargo theme supports the following post formats:

- `gallery` - A gallery of images, which will be displayed in a responsive image slider, powered by Flexslider.
- `image` - A single image, which will be shown above post title.
- `video` - A single video, which can be any video from Youtube, Video or other video websites. Support URL or embed code. The video will be displayed above post title.
- `audio` - An audio file, which can be any video from Youtube, Video or other video websites. Support URL or embed code. The video will be displayed using a powerful HTML5 audio player provided by Wordpress as default player.
- `quote` - A question.

Using post format in gocargo lets you differentiate post from each other and make the blog page / single page looks more beautiful.

[Go to blog page](http://demo.vegatheme.com/gocargo/news/) to see how post formats look.




When you edit a post, select a format you want to apply to that post on the **Format** meta box on the right:

![formats](images/post-format-box.png)

When you choose a format, a corresponding meta box will appear **below** the content editor, here's the list of them:

![formats](images/post-formats.png)

All you need to do is just enter **all** information in the fields in these meta boxes. This information will be used to decorate the post. For example: gallery post format will uses uploaded images to show a slider above post title, a video post will display a video player above post title, etc.

----------------------------


Translation
=========

###Tell WordPress which language file to use.

If you don’t use WordPress in your native language so far, you have to tell WordPress which language to use to activate the theme translation.

You can do this by editing the wp-config.php file (the file is located in the main directory of your WordPress files) and defining the WPLANG constant. You have to set your language code there, for example fr_FR for French translation.

ust add the line below to your wp-config.php or change it if it already exists:

`define ('WPLANG', 'fr_FR');`


###First Method: Using Codestyling Plugin

The easiest way to translate your theme locally is by using the [Codestyling Localization](https://wordpress.org/plugins/codestyling-localization/) plugin. After you have installed and activated the plugin, simply go to `Tools > Localization` (shown in your language) and translate the theme from your WordPress backend following the [plugin instructions](http://www.code-styling.de/english/development/wordpress-plugin-codestyling-localization-en)

###Second Mothod: Using Poedit

Poedit is a common program which you can use to translate the theme. It’s available for free on [poedit.net](http://www.poedit.net/).

After you have installed Poedit, you can open it and select `File > New Catalog from POT file`. Then select the .pot file from the theme you wish to translate which you can find in the `/languages/` folder of theme.

Then go through every line of text and translate it to your native language. Afterwards you can save the catalog with your language code (for example `en_US.po`). Normally Poedit automatically creates the .mo file and saves it, too.

The last step you have to do is to upload your created language files to the language folder of your theme using FTP.


------------------------------


Child Theme
===========

Fastlat is fully child theme compatible. We have attached a basic child theme to the download package which contains the minimum of required files. If you are planing any code customisations we highly recommend to do this inside the child theme! Learn more about child themes [here](http://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes)
